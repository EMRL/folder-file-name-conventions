# Folder and File Conventions

**Do not use special characters**

Avoid using non-alphanumeric characters in file names, such as: '*' ':' '' '/' '<' '>' '|' '"' '!' '?' '[' ']' ';' '=' '+' '&' '£' '$' '€' '%' or ','. These characters can have special meaning in programming languages or can cause problems with different operating systems.
